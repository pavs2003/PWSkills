    "Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "it is useful because it is IO-bound processes, such as reading files from a network or database since each thread can run the IO-bound process concurrently. Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound processes, such as computationally heavy tasks since it will benefit from having multiple processors; similar to how multicore computers work faster than computers with a single core."
