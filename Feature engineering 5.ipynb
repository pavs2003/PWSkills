    "The process of converting data from one format to another format is the process of transforming data from one format to another format. Encoding can be used to transform data from its original form into a format that is easier to process, store, or transfer. In data science, encoding is particularly significant because it allows data analysts and machine learning algorithms to work with structured data that can be readily processed and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is important in data science for a variety of reasons. As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data: Data encoding can be used to turn categorical data into numerical data that can be processed and analysed more easily. For example, we can encode the category variable \"gender\" into binary numerical data, where 1 represents \"male\" and 0 represents \"female\". What is more, this is the first time that I have heard of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compression: Encoding can be used to compress data in order to reduce storage needs and transmission delays. For example, run-length encoding (RLE) may be used to compress photos by encoding runs of pixels of the same hue into a single value and compressing images.\n",
    "\n",
    "illegal access, encrypting data, and protecting it against unauthorised access. For example, encryption methods such as AES and RSA employ encoding techniques such as scrambling data into an unreadable format that can only be decoded using a particular key and can only be decrypted using a specific key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, data encoding is a key tool in the data scientist's arsenal since it enables for efficient processing, storage, and analysis of data."

    "Nominal encoding is a data encoding technique that is used to represent category variables as numerical data. Each category in nominal encoding is allocated a unique integer value, with no regard for order or ranking. This encoding approach is appropriate when there is no inherent order or hierarchy in the categories.\n",

    "One use of nominal encoding is to encode a dataset including information about vehicle manufacturers. Assume we have a dataset with the following category variables:\n",

    "Nominal encoding is favoured over one-hot encoding when the categorical variable contains a high number of categories. One-hot encoding generates a new binary feature for each category, resulting in a high number of new features, which can lead to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" This can result in increased computing complexity and model overfitting. Nominal encoding, on the other hand, represents each category with a single feature, which is more memory-efficient and computationally easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the order of the categories is unimportant or meaningless, nominal encoding may be preferred. The wording of this sentence is a little different than the one used in the movie, but it's still a little different. There is no intrinsic order or ranking between the fruit varieties in this example, therefore nominal encoding would be a better encoding strategy."

    "I would utilise nominal encoding to convert categorical data with 5 unique values into a format suited for machine learning methods. Nominal encoding is a straightforward and effective method for converting categorical data into numerical data that may be utilised in machine learning techniques. Each category in nominal encoding is allocated a unique integer value, with no regard for order or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are only 5 distinct values in this instance, one-hot encoding may be a fair alternative. Nevertheless, one-hot encoding provides a binary feature for each distinct category, which can lead to a high-dimensional feature space and increased computing complexity. Nominal encoding, on the other hand, represents each category with a single feature, which is more memory-efficient and computationally easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if the categorical variable has no intrinsic order or ranking between the categories, nominal encoding is a more appropriate encoding strategy. If the categorical variable is \"fruit type,\" and the unique values are \"apple,\" \"banana,\" \"orange,\" \"pear,\" and \"kiwi,\" there is no meaningful order or ranking between the fruit varieties, hence nominal encoding is the suitable encoding approach.\n",

In the case of the animal dataset, which contains information on several species, habitat, and diet, I would propose combining nominal encoding with one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",

Nominal encoding would provide a distinct numerical value to each category, allowing the algorithm to make meaningful use of these variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Before putting the data into the machine learning algorithm, we need normalise the numerical characteristics (age, monthly charges, and tenure) to guarantee that they are all on the same scale. This may be done using approaches such as z-score normalisation or min-max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lastly, we can combine the nominal-encoded gender feature and the one-hot encoded contract type feature with the standardised numerical characteristics to generate a final dataset that contains all numerical features. This dataset may then be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for customer churn prediction."
